# Ballista: Distributed Scheduler for Apache Arrow DataFusion

Ballista is a distributed compute platform primarily implemented in Rust, and powered by Apache Arrow and
DataFusion. It is built on an architecture that allows other programming languages (such as Python, C++, and
Java) to be supported as first-class citizens without paying a penalty for serialization costs.

The foundational technologies in Ballista are:

- [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) memory model and compute kernels for efficient processing of data.
- [Apache Arrow Flight Protocol](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2019/10/13/introducing-arrow-flight/) for efficient
  data transfer between processes.
- [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) for serializing query plans.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for packaging up executors along with user-defined code.

Ballista can be deployed as a standalone cluster and also supports [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). In either
case, the scheduler can be configured to use [etcd](https://etcd.io/) as a backing store to (eventually) provide
redundancy in the case of a scheduler failing.

## Rust Version Compatibility

This crate is tested with the latest stable version of Rust. We do not currrently test against other, older versions of the Rust compiler.

## Starting a cluster

There are numerous ways to start a Ballista cluster, including support for Docker and
Kubernetes. For full documentation, refer to the deployment section of the
[Ballista User Guide](https://datafusion.apache.org/ballista/user-guide/deployment/)

A simple way to start a local cluster for testing purposes is to use cargo to install
the scheduler and executor crates.

```bash
cargo install --locked ballista-scheduler
cargo install --locked ballista-executor
```

With these crates installed, it is now possible to start a scheduler process.

```bash
RUST_LOG=info ballista-scheduler
```

The scheduler will bind to port `50050` by default.

Next, start an executor processes in a new terminal session with the specified concurrency
level.

```bash
RUST_LOG=info ballista-executor -c 4
```

The executor will bind to port `50051` by default. Additional executors can be started by
manually specifying a bind port. For example:

```bash
RUST_LOG=info ballista-executor --bind-port 50052 -c 4
```

## Executing a query

Ballista provides a `BallistaContext` as a starting point for creating queries. DataFrames can be created
by invoking the `read_csv`, `read_parquet`, and `sql` methods.

To build a simple ballista example, run the following command to add the dependencies to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```bash
cargo add ballista datafusion tokio
```

The following example runs a simple aggregate SQL query against a Parquet file (`yellow_tripdata_2022-01.parquet`) from the
[New York Taxi and Limousine Commission](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
data set. Download the file and add it to the `testdata` folder before running the example.

```rust,no_run
use ballista::prelude::*;
use datafusion::prelude::{col, ParquetReadOptions};
use datafusion::functions_aggregate::{min_max::min, min_max::max, sum::sum, average::avg};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // create configuration
    let config = BallistaConfig::builder()
        .set("ballista.shuffle.partitions", "4")
        .build()?;

    // connect to Ballista scheduler
    let ctx = BallistaContext::remote("localhost", 50050, &config).await?;

    let filename = "testdata/yellow_tripdata_2022-01.parquet";

    // define the query using the DataFrame trait
    let df = ctx
        .read_parquet(filename, ParquetReadOptions::default())
        .await?
        .select_columns(&["passenger_count", "fare_amount"])?
        .aggregate(
            vec![col("passenger_count")],
            vec![
                min(col("fare_amount")),
                max(col("fare_amount")),
                avg(col("fare_amount")),
                sum(col("fare_amount")),
            ],
        )?
        .sort(vec![col("passenger_count").sort(true, true)])?;

    // this is equivalent to the following SQL
    // SELECT passenger_count, MIN(fare_amount), MAX(fare_amount), AVG(fare_amount), SUM(fare_amount)
    //     FROM tripdata
    //     GROUP BY passenger_count
    //     ORDER BY passenger_count

    // print the results
    df.show().await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

The output should look similar to the following table.

```text
+-----------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| passenger_count | MIN(?table?.fare_amount) | MAX(?table?.fare_amount) | AVG(?table?.fare_amount) | SUM(?table?.fare_amount) |
