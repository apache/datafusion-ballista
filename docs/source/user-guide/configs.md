# Configuration

## BallistaContext Configuration Settings

Ballista has a number of configuration settings that can be specified when creating a BallistaContext.

_Example: Specifying configuration options when creating a context_

```rust
let config = BallistaConfig::builder()
.set("ballista.shuffle.partitions", "200")
.set("ballista.batch.size", "16384")
.build() ?;

let ctx = BallistaContext::remote("localhost", 50050, & config).await?;
```

### Ballista Configuration Settings

| --------------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ballista.job.name                 | Utf8    | N/A     | Sets the job name that will appear in the web user interface for any submitted jobs.                                                                                      |
| ballista.shuffle.partitions       | UInt16  | 16      | Sets the default number of partitions to create when repartitioning query stages.                                                                                         |
| ballista.batch.size               | UInt16  | 8192    | Sets the default batch size.                                                                                                                                              |
| ballista.repartition.joins        | Boolean | true    | When set to true, Ballista will repartition data using the join keys to execute joins in parallel using the provided `ballista.shuffle.partitions` level.                 |
| ballista.repartition.aggregations | Boolean | true    | When set to true, Ballista will repartition data using the aggregate keys to execute aggregates in parallel using the provided `ballista.shuffle.partitions` level.       |
| ballista.repartition.windows      | Boolean | true    | When set to true, Ballista will repartition data using the partition keys to execute window functions in parallel using the provided `ballista.shuffle.partitions` level. |
| ballista.parquet.pruning          | Boolean | true    | Determines whether Parquet pruning should be enabled or not.                                                                                                              |
| ballista.with_information_schema  | Boolean | true    | Determines whether the `information_schema` should be created in the context. This is necessary for supporting DDL commands such as `SHOW TABLES`.                        |

### DataFusion Configuration Settings

In addition to Ballista-specific configuration settings, the following DataFusion settings can also be specified.

| key                                             | type    | default | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| datafusion.execution.coalesce_batches           | Boolean | true    | When set to true, record batches will be examined between each operator and small batches will be coalesced into larger batches. This is helpful when there are highly selective filters or joins that could produce tiny output batches. The target batch size is determined by the configuration setting 'datafusion.execution.coalesce_target_batch_size'. |
| datafusion.execution.coalesce_target_batch_size | UInt64  | 4096    | Target batch size when coalescing batches. Uses in conjunction with the configuration setting 'datafusion.execution.coalesce_batches'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| datafusion.explain.logical_plan_only            | Boolean | false   | When set to true, the explain statement will only print logical plans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| datafusion.explain.physical_plan_only           | Boolean | false   | When set to true, the explain statement will only print physical plans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| datafusion.optimizer.filter_null_join_keys      | Boolean | false   | When set to true, the optimizer will insert filters before a join between a nullable and non-nullable column to filter out nulls on the nullable side. This filter can add additional overhead when the file format does not fully support predicate push down.                                                                                               |
| datafusion.optimizer.skip_failed_rules          | Boolean | true    | When set to true, the logical plan optimizer will produce warning messages if any optimization rules produce errors and then proceed to the next rule. When set to false, any rules that produce errors will cause the query to fail.                                                                                                                         |

## Ballista Scheduler Configuration Settings

Besides the BallistaContext configuration settings, a few configuration settings for the Ballista scheduler to better
manage the whole cluster are also needed to be taken care of.

_Example: Specifying configuration options when starting the scheduler_

```shell
./ballista-scheduler --scheduler-policy push-staged --event-loop-buffer-size 1000000 --executor-slots-policy
round-robin-local
```

| key                                          | type   | default     | description                                                                                                                                                                     |

| event-loop-buffer-size                       | UInt32 | 10000       | Sets the event loop buffer size. for a system of high throughput, a larger value like 1000000 is recommended.                                                                   |
| executor-slots-policy                        | Utf8   | bias        | Sets the executor slots policy for the scheduler, possible values: bias, round-robin, round-robin-local. For a cluster with single scheduler, round-robin-local is recommended. |
| finished-job-data-clean-up-interval-seconds  | UInt64 | 300         | Sets the delayed interval for cleaning up finished job data, mainly the shuffle data, 0 means the cleaning up is disabled.                                                      |
| finished-job-state-clean-up-interval-seconds | UInt64 | 3600        | Sets the delayed interval for cleaning up finished job state stored in the backend, 0 means the cleaning up is disabled.                                                        |
| advertise-flight-sql-endpoint                | Utf8   | N/A         | Sets the route endpoint for proxying flight sql results via scheduler.                                                                                                          |
