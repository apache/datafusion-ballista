# Tuning Guide

## Partitions and Parallelism

The goal of any distributed compute engine is to parallelize work as much as possible, allowing the work to scale
by adding more compute resource.

The basic unit of concurrency and parallelism in Ballista is the concept of a partition. The leaf nodes of a query
are typically table scans that read from files on disk and Ballista currently treats each file within a table as a
single partition (in the future, Ballista will support splitting files into partitions but this is not implemented yet).

For example, if there is a table "customer" that consists of 200 Parquet files, that table scan will naturally have
200 partitions and the table scan and certain subsequent operations will also have 200 partitions. Conversely, if the
table only has a single Parquet file then there will be a single partition and the work will not be able to scale even
if the cluster has resource available. Ballista supports repartitioning within a query to improve parallelism.
The configuration setting `datafusion.execution.target_partitions`can be set to the desired number of partitions. This is
currently a global setting for the entire context. The default value for this setting is 16.

Note that Ballista will never decrease the number of partitions based on this setting and will only repartition if
the source operation has fewer partitions than this setting.

Example: Setting the desired number of shuffle partitions when creating a context.

```rust
use ballista::extension::{SessionConfigExt, SessionContextExt};

let session_config = SessionConfig::new_with_ballista()
    .with_target_partitions(200);

let state = SessionStateBuilder::new()
    .with_default_features()
    .with_config(session_config)
    .build();

let ctx: SessionContext = SessionContext::remote_with_state(&url,state).await?;
```

## Configuring Executor Concurrency Levels

Each executor instance has a fixed number of tasks that it can process concurrently. This is specified by passing a
`concurrent_tasks` command-line parameter. The default setting is to use all available CPU cores.

Increasing this configuration setting will increase the number of tasks that each executor can run concurrently but
this will also mean that the executor will use more memory. If executors are failing due to out-of-memory errors then
decreasing the number of concurrent tasks may help.

In the future, Ballista will have better support for tracking memory usage and allocating tasks based on available
memory, as well as supporting spill-to-disk to reduce memory pressure.

## Push-based vs Pull-based Task Scheduling

Ballista supports both push-based and pull-based task scheduling. It is recommended that you try both to determine
which is the best for your use case.

Pull-based scheduling works in a similar way to Apache Spark and push-based scheduling can result in lower latency.

The scheduling policy can be specified in the `--scheduler_policy` parameter when starting the scheduler and executor
processes. The default is `pull-based`.

## Viewing Query Plans and Metrics

The scheduler provides a REST API for monitoring jobs. See the
[scheduler documentation](scheduler.md) for more information.

> This is optional scheduler feature which should be enabled with rest-api feature

To download a query plan in dot format from the scheduler, submit a request to the following API endpoint

```
http://localhost:50050/api/job/{job_id}/dot
```

The resulting file can be converted into an image using `graphviz`:

```bash
dot -Tpng query.dot > query.png
```

Here is an example query plan:
