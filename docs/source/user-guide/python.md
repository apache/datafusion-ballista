# Ballista Python Bindings

Ballista provides Python bindings, allowing SQL and DataFrame queries to be executed from the Python shell.

Like PySpark, it allows you to build a plan through SQL or a DataFrame API against Parquet, CSV, JSON, and other
popular file formats files, run it in a distributed environment, and obtain the result back in Python.

## Connecting to a Cluster

The following code demonstrates how to create a Ballista context and connect to a scheduler.

If you are running a standalone cluster (runs locally), all you need to do is call the stand alone cluster method `standalone()` or your BallistaContext. If you are running a cluster in remote mode, you need to provide the URL `Ballista.remote("http://my-remote-ip:50050")`.

```text
>>> from ballista import BallistaBuilder
>>> # for a standalone instance
>>> # Ballista will initiate with an empty config
>>> # set config variables with `config()`
>>> ballista = BallistaBuilder()\
>>>    .config("ballista.job.name", "example ballista")
>>>
>>> ctx = ballista.standalone()
>>>
>>> # for a remote instance provide the URL
>>> ctx = ballista.remote("df://url-path-to-scheduler:50050")
```

## SQL

The Python bindings support executing SQL queries as well.

### Registering Tables

Before SQL queries can be executed, tables need to be registered with the context.

Tables can be registered against the context by calling one of the `register` methods, or by executing SQL.

```text
>>> ctx.register_parquet("trips", "/mnt/bigdata/nyctaxi")
```

```text
>>> ctx.sql("CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE trips STORED AS PARQUET LOCATION '/mnt/bigdata/nyctaxi'")
```

### Executing Queries

The `sql` method creates a `DataFrame`. The query is executed when an action such as `show` or `collect` is executed.

### Showing Query Results

```text
>>> df = ctx.sql("SELECT count(*) FROM trips")
>>> df.show()
+-----------------+
| COUNT(UInt8(1)) |
+-----------------+
| 9071244         |
+-----------------+
```

### Collecting Query Results

The `collect` method executes the query and returns the results in
[PyArrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html) record batches.

```text
>>> df = ctx.sql("SELECT count(*) FROM trips")
>>> df.collect()
[pyarrow.RecordBatch
COUNT(UInt8(1)): int64]
```

### Viewing Query Plans

The `explain` method can be used to show the logical and physical query plans for a query.

```text
>>> df.explain()
+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| plan_type     | plan                                                        |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| logical_plan  | Projection: #COUNT(UInt8(1))                                |
|               |   Aggregate: groupBy=[[]], aggr=[[COUNT(UInt8(1))]]         |
|               |     TableScan: trips projection=[VendorID]                  |
| physical_plan | ProjectionExec: expr=[COUNT(UInt8(1))@0 as COUNT(UInt8(1))] |
|               |   ProjectionExec: expr=[9071244 as COUNT(UInt8(1))]         |
|               |     EmptyExec: produce_one_row=true                         |
|               |                                                             |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## DataFrame

The following example demonstrates creating arrays with PyArrow and then creating a Ballista DataFrame.

```python
from ballista import BallistaBuilder
import pyarrow

# an alias
# TODO implement Functions
f = ballista.functions

# create a context
ctx = Ballista().standalone()

# create a RecordBatch and a new DataFrame from it
batch = pyarrow.RecordBatch.from_arrays(
    [pyarrow.array([1, 2, 3]), pyarrow.array([4, 5, 6])],
    names=["a", "b"],
)
df = ctx.create_dataframe([[batch]])

# create a new statement
df = df.select(
    f.col("a") + f.col("b"),
    f.col("a") - f.col("b"),
)

# execute and collect the first (and only) batch
result = df.collect()[0]

assert result.column(0) == pyarrow.array([5, 7, 9])
assert result.column(1) == pyarrow.array([-3, -3, -3])
```

## User Defined Functions

The underlying DataFusion query engine supports Python UDFs but this functionality has not yet been implemented in
Ballista. It is planned for a future release. The tracking issue is [#173](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-ballista/issues/173).
