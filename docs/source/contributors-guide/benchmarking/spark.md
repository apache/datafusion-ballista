# Spark Benchmark Configuration

How vanilla Spark 4.1.3 was configured for the TPC-H SF1000 results on the
[benchmarking page](index.md). The cluster, data and queries are described in
[Benchmark Environment](environment.md).

## Spark configuration (highlights)

Both Spark runs use these settings. The vanilla Spark run has no Comet
plugin and uses the stock `SortShuffleManager`.

| `spark.executor.cores`                                     | `16` (task parallelism per executor) |

| `spark.memory.storageFraction`                             | `0.2`                                |
| `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`                             | `512`                                |

| `spark.serializer`                                         | `KryoSerializer`                     |
| `spark.io.compression.codec`                               | `zstd`                               |

Spark AQE is left at its Spark 4.1 defaults. Shuffle spills to a `gp3`-backed
per-executor volume (`spark.kubernetes.executor.volumes...spark-local-dir-1`).

Note that `spark.executor.cores=16` is Spark's **task parallelism** setting,
not a CPU allocation — each executor pod is given only **8 physical vCPU**
via `spark.kubernetes.executor.limit.cores` / `.request.cores`, so Spark
schedules 16 concurrent tasks onto 8 physical cores (2× oversubscription).
The matching Ballista executor runs `--vcores=8` on the same
8 physical vCPU (1:1).

## Reproducing

With the scripts in
[`benchmarks/cluster`](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-ballista/tree/main/benchmarks/cluster),
after setting up `cluster.toml` as its README describes:

```sh
cd benchmarks/cluster
python3 run.py --engine spark
```

The settings above are in `benchmarks/cluster/conf/spark.conf`. The driver runs
`spark/tpcbench.py` in client mode in a Kubernetes Job, and Spark starts the
executors with a volume each for shuffle files, from the storage class in
`cluster.toml`.
