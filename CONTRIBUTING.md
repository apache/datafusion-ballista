# Introduction

We welcome and encourage contributions of all kinds, such as:

1. Tickets with issue reports of feature requests
2. Documentation improvements
3. Code (PR or PR Review)

In addition to submitting new PRs, we have a healthy tradition of community members helping review each other's PRs.
Doing so is a great way to help the community as well as get more familiar with Rust and the relevant codebases.

You can find a curated
[good-first-issue](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-ballista/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
list to help you get started.

# Developer's Guide

This section describes how you can get started with Ballista development.

## Bootstrap Environment

Ballista contains components implemented in the following programming languages:

- Rust (Scheduler and Executor processes, Client library)

### Rust Environment

We use the standard Rust development tools.

- `cargo build`
- `cargo fmt` to format the code
- `cargo test` to test
- etc.

Testing setup:

- `rustup update stable` DataFusion uses the latest stable release of rust

Formatting instructions:

- [ci/scripts/rust_fmt.sh](ci/scripts/rust_fmt.sh)
- [ci/scripts/rust_clippy.sh](ci/scripts/rust_clippy.sh)
- [ci/scripts/rust_toml_fmt.sh](ci/scripts/rust_toml_fmt.sh)

or run them all at once:

- [dev/rust_lint.sh](dev/rust_lint.sh)

### Rust Process Configuration

The scheduler and executor processes can be configured using toml files, environment variables and command-line
arguments. The specification for config options can be found here:

- [ballista/scheduler/scheduler_config_spec.toml](ballista/scheduler/scheduler_config_spec.toml)
- [ballista/executor/executor_config_spec.toml](ballista/executor/executor_config_spec.toml)

Those files fully define Ballista's configuration. If there is a discrepancy between this documentation and the
files, assume those files are correct.

To get a list of command-line arguments, run the binary with `--help`

There is an example config file at [ballista/executor/examples/example_executor_config.toml](ballista/executor/examples/example_executor_config.toml)

The order of precedence for arguments is: default config file < environment variables < specified config file < command line arguments.

The executor and scheduler will look for the default config file at `/etc/ballista/[executor|scheduler].toml` To
specify a config file use the `--config-file` argument.

Environment variables are prefixed by `BALLISTA_EXECUTOR` or `BALLISTA_SCHEDULER` for the executor and scheduler
respectively. Hyphens in command line arguments become underscores. For example, the `--scheduler-host` argument
for the executor becomes `BALLISTA_EXECUTOR_SCHEDULER_HOST`

### Python Environment

Refer to the instructions in the Python Bindings [README](./python/README.md)

## Integration Tests

The integration tests can be executed by running the following command from the root of the repository.

```bash
./dev/integration-tests.sh
```

## How to format `.md` document

We are using `prettier` to format `.md` files.

You can either use `npm i -g prettier` to install it globally or use `npx` to run it as a standalone binary. Using `npx` required a working node environment. Upgrading to the latest prettier is recommended (by adding `--upgrade` to the `npm` command).

```bash
$ prettier --version
2.3.0
```

After you've confirmed your prettier version, you can format all the `.md` files:

```bash
prettier -w README.md {ballista,ballista-cli,benchmarks,dev,docs,examples,python}/**/*.md
```
